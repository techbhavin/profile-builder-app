# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Questions

 ###  Q. What was your approach for this project? Did it change as you developed the app further?

- I choose the approach to first design the flow on the paper that makes it easier to visualise. Thenafter, I started with the design part i.e. the first clickable of it that makes the flow clear and then wrote the logic and validation of the components. I made some changes in the design later for better UX.

### Q. What were the challenges you faced?

- Using Form Lib with Antd was a challenge as Formik doesn't gel up very well for Antd for eg. Setting up Field array is difficult with the 3rd party binding lib that Formik claims works with Antd.
- Without Css designing has been a challenge. If with css would have been much more Visually attractive

###	Q. How differently will you do if you had a couple of more days to complete the assignment? What if you have one full month?

- Currently working with local storage. If got more time would use Redux or any Store management tool with Hydrate functionality. 
- UI/UX improvements with better designs.
- Can add attachment support and API support
- Advanced Filters in the Table Search for users.
